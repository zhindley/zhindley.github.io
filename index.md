## About Me

My name is Zach Hindley and I am a student at the Roux Institute, a new campus of Northeastern University in Portland Maine. Currently I am working on a masters in computer science with a focus in Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning planning to graduate May, 2023. I recieved my bachelor degrees from the University of Maine where I studied Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics. 

## About My Advisor

[Dr. Michal Aibin](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/michal-aibin/) is an associate professor of computer science at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at  Northeastern University’s Vancouver campus. Outside of his role at Northeastern, he is also a research faculty member at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. His research interests include the optimization of various processes using adaptive approaches, such as machine learning. His recent focus is on cognitive networking. In particular, data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning concepts applied to optical networks to enable cognitive network data analysis.

Aibin began his doctoral studies at the Department of Systems and Computer Networks at the Wroclaw University of Technology in 2012, where he was twice awarded the dean’s award and a scholarship to the best doctoral students. He received his doctoral degree in June 2017 by defending his thesis: “Dynamic Routing Algorithms for Cloud-Ready Elastic Optical Networks.” He currently upholds his first academic position in the Department of Computing at the British Columbia University of Technology in Vancouver, Canada, where he was awarded the Employee Excellence Award in the applied research category. He joined Northeastern University in 2020 as a part-time associate professor.


## About My Project

The project I am working on is the detection of defects in air craft using computer vision (CV). The intent is to allow a drone to visually detect defects reducing the use of man hours in aircraft inspections. The scope of the project is to gather a dataset and optimize a CV algorithm. Our system will be based on single-shot multi-object detection techniques as there is the possibility of multiple occurences of defects in a single image and a need for fast processing. Emphasis will be on reducing false negative (missing defects) at the expense of false positives (incorrectly labeling as defective), this tradeoff will be controlled by an adjustable decision threshold.
