## About Me

My name is Zach Hindley and I am a student at the Roux Institute, a new campus of Northeastern University, in Portland Maine. Currently I am working on a masters in computer science with a focus in Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning. I am an Align student, which is a program intended for people without a computer science background, as I received both a degree in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Maine.

## About My Advisor

Dr. Michal Aibin is an associate professor of computer science at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at  Northeastern University’s Vancouver campus. Outside of his role at Northeastern, he is also a research faculty member at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. His research interests include the optimization of various processes using adaptive approaches, such as machine learning. His recent focus is on cognitive networking. In particular, data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning concepts applied to optical networks to enable cognitive network data analysis.

Aibin began his doctoral studies at the Department of Systems and Computer Networks at the Wroclaw University of Technology in 2012, where he was twice awarded the dean’s award and a scholarship to the best doctoral students. He received his doctoral degree in June 2017 by defending his thesis: “Dynamic Routing Algorithms for Cloud-Ready Elastic Optical Networks.” He currently upholds his first academic position in the Department of Computing at the British Columbia University of Technology in Vancouver, Canada, where he was awarded the Employee Excellence Award in the applied research category. He joined Northeastern University in 2020 as a part-time associate professor.

## About My Project

The project is to detect defects in air craft using computer vision (CV). The intent is to allow the detection of defects utilizing a drone reducing man hours spent
inspecting aircraft. The scope of the project is to gather a dataset which we will be used to optimize a CV algorithm.
