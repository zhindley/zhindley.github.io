After we worked out some issues getting Roboflow to run, multiple team members were not able to run the training. We worked this out and trained the model on the newly 
data set. Map values for this training set was fairly low, on all classes it was around .25%. Classes like peeling and crackc really lowered the scores as they covered
large areas but the crack/corosion actually covered a small number of pixels. This confused the model as it correctly identifies the location the fault but does not
correctly match the bounding box.

Additionally we started the work on the flight tunnel project. Video had been previously collected of incoming aircraft, a script was created to grab frames from the
video to use as traininn images. I was tasked with finding images of some of the planes that were expected to be landing such as the DHC Beaver and the Sikorsky s76.
These images were used to keep the model more generic and not only training on the few individual planes that came into the harbor while we filmed.
