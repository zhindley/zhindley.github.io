After previously cleaning the set we tried the YOLOv7 algorithm and compared it to the YOLOv5 algorithm, which we found didn't perform any better. Members of the team located in Vancouver were able to capture an additional 450 images of aircraft that we needed to then annotate. Additionally video of incoming aircraft was collected for the flight tunnel project. 
While annotating the dataset an observations was made out of the labels, "missing screw", "dent", "corrosion", "peeling", and "crack" it was flound that the dent class was almost non existant. Along with that it was difficult class to label, as even between members it was hard to agree on what was correctly labeled as a dent. The rest of the time was taken by the team to make bounding boxes.
