The training has been now done on a combined data set of the previous images as well as the new images that we collected, which is rougly 1000 images.
The corosion and crack class continue to cause issues, both having a poor recall score. We made one last push into re-annotating the images, shrinking bounding boxes and removing overlapping boxes if possible.   
Tianyi Chen trained the flight tunnel model on our data set, he produced some video of the object detection. It was interesting seeing all the annotating produce a product. The video had an adjustable threshold, which we set low as falsley identifying an aircraft has little impact but missing an incoming an aircraft would be more problamatic. The intention of the flight tunnel project is to detect aircraft incoming to the airport and allow drone pilots to move out of the airspace. The planes move from the water, over the city in the background, and into the air. We decided not to label aircraft over the city as we thought with limited data it would not be possible, and since we are only concerned with the incoming and taking off of aircraft being able to detect them in between is not useful. It was interesting to me to see when and what is usefull to label and the tradeoffs and thought process that goes into the machine learning.
