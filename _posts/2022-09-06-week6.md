The team worked on annotating the flight tunnel images, some of the initial work needed to be redone as the bounding boxes needed to be redone as they were a little too loose for good model performance. In general the bounding of the incoming aircrafte is simpler than the defects, as the aircraft are easier to put in a rectangular bounding box (which Yolov5 uses).
We continued to work on the bounding boxes for the aircraft defects, trying to improve the map score for corrosion and cracks. This poses an interesting idea where we put less emphasis on the map score and look more at the models ability to correctly label the defect. As long as the defect gets flagged it it is not that important to get the bounding box exactly correct. Even though our model correctly flagged the defects for the report and final model our advisor recommended not focusing on theses particular defects. We tried loosening the boxes and creating one large bounding box to cover areas that would have been labeled with many smaller bounding boxes. This did not increase the performance metrics.
