At this point the models have been trained and we are getting to hand off the work to our industy partner. This is primarily the weights files to run the model and
documentation on how to use them To this end we have been tasked with creating handoff documents. We also have to create two final reports for the projects, as my main
work was on the aircraft defects the final report on this page is the one for that project. As classes have also started this part is going a bit slower but we are 
looking to wrap this up.
The end point is that our models are working decently and as a proof of concept it proved the technology. In the future it would be nice to do more optimization to 
the model as well as work on how to get these models working real time.
